```

Model A:
The model failed to add space before unit of currency (dollar, cent). For input amount 1, the function should return "One Cent" instead it returned "OneCent".

Model B:
NA


Model c:
The model failed to add space before unit of currency (dollar, cent).
For input amount 1, the function should return "One Cent" instead it returned "OneCent".


Model D:
NA

Model E:
The model failed to add space before the unit of currency (dollar, cent).
For input amount 1, the function should return "One Cent" instead it returned "OneCent".


The model failed to calculate cent values.
The model used `Math.floor` function to calculate dollars and cents from the input amount, because of this the values are not calculated correctly.


The model failed to handle amount = 0, it should return "Zero Dollars" instead it returned empty string.


Incorrect:
- The incorrect solution failed to add space before the unit of currency (dollar, cent). For input amount 1, the function should return "One Cent" instead it returned "OneCent".
- The incorrect solution failed to handle amount = 0, it should have returned "Zero Dollars" Instead it returned an empty string.


Correct:
- In comparision with incorrect solution, the correct solution correctly added space before the unit of currency.
- The ideal solution handled input amount=0, it handled the condition seperately and returned the string "Zero Dollars".
