The model failed to calculate values for histogram correctly.
The keys for histogram should be like "0-100", "101-200", "201-300" and so on.
THe model returned histogram with keys as "0-100", "100-200", "200-300" and so on.



The model failed to calculate values for the histogram correctly.
The keys for the histogram should be "0-100", "101-200", "201-300" and so on.
The model returned a histogram with keys "0-99", "100-199", "200-299" and so on.


The model failed to calculate `slowestEndpoints` properly.
The path in the slowest endpoints should be a URL endpoint, it should not add an HTTP verb.
The expected path is "/api/orders", the model returns the  path "GET /api/orders"

The model failed to calculate `slowestEndpoints` properly.
The `avgResponseTime` field in `slowestEndpoints` should be rounded to the nearest value.
The expected value for `avgResponseTime` should be an integer, it should not have a fraction.



The model failed to calculate values for the histogram correctly.
The keys for the histogram should be "0-100", "101-200", "201-300" and so on.
The model returned a histogram with keys '0-100', '101-200', '201-300', and so on. The keys should be consistent and non-overlapping.


Incorrect solution

- The incorrect solution failed to calculate `slowestEndpoints` properly. The `avgResponseTime` field in `slowestEndpoints` should be rounded to the nearest value. The expected value for `avgResponseTime` should be an integer, it should not have a fraction.

- The model failed to calculate values for histogram correctly. The keys for histogram should be like "0-100", "101-200", "201-300" and so on. The model returned histogram with keys as "0-100", "100-200", "200-300" and so on.


Ideal solution

- As compared with the incorrect solution, the ideal solution calculated `slowestEndpoints` correctly. It correctly rounded the `avgResponseTime` value to the nearest integer value using the `Math.round` function.

- The ideal solution correctly calculated histogram values. The keys in the histogram are set correctly with required values like "0-100", "101-200", "201-300" and so on.
