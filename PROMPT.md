Please change the mentioned code to the modern ES6 class-based structure. 
Ensure encapsulation, modular construction, and the reusability of methods. 
Individual edge cases must be taken into custody by input validation and clear error messages. 
Use data structures as opposed to fixed-size arrays, and optimize the entire way through by removing redundancy. Use let/const for variable declaration, template literals for concatenation of strings, and async/await operations for improved readability. All properties and methods must be initialized appropriately. To promote clarity and maintainability of code, break down portions of it into smaller reusable components. Keep the refactored code clean, optimized, and well-annotated
