- Incorrect solution explanation and Ideal Response Explanation (+ Ideal Response): 
The explanation stated might be incorrect. 

The first point should return false instead of throwing an error, as per the prompt. 

Can you check this again for the ideal response code? The ideal response should comply with the prompt requirements. 
Adjustment is required in the ideal response explanation afterward. 
Please double-check this point "parameter validations were added to the constructor, setUserRole, and isRequestAllowed functions" and the last point.

Check the unit test "if maxRequests is zero then it should return false" again. 
The response evaluation review will be done after these adjustments are made.

---

In prompt the the statement
"if maxRequests is zero then it should return false"
is applied to isRequestAllowed function, not to constructor or other functions.

Test case at line number 51, confirms this requirement, it creates RateLimiter instance with positive maxRequests value then sets it to zero.

```javascript
    it('should deny all requests if maxRequests is 0', function() {
      const rateLimiter = new RateLimiter(3, 1000, 60000);
      rateLimiter.maxRequests = 0;
      expect(rateLimiter.isRequestAllowed('user1')).toBe(false);
    });
```





- Add validations to the constructor that maxRequests, penaltyDuration, and timeWindow should be positive number values.
- Complete the function `isRequestAllowed(userId)`:
    - Add validation to the `userId` parameter that userId should be a non-empty string.
    - if maxRequests is zero then it should return false.
    - Add penalty check, if a user is under penalty, their requests should be denied until the penalty period is over.
    - If the penalty period is over, the penalty should be removed.
    - Add role-based rate limiting, different roles have different rate limits, If the user has no role then the default role limit should be applied.
    - Use userTimestamps to store user request timestamps and expired timestamps should be removed.
    - If the number of valid (non-expired) requests is below the role limit, then the current timestamp should be added to the user's request timestamps and it should return true.
    - If the number of valid requests meets or exceeds the role limit, then a penalty should be applied to the user and it should return false.
    - When a user exceeds their rate limit, a penalty should be applied, User requests should be blocked for a specified duration (penaltyDuration).
