It should be something like "The model returned inconsistent and overlapping bucket ranges like '0-100', '100-100', '100-200', '200-200', etc."

YM: 
The model failed to calculate values for the histogram correctly.
The keys for the histogram should be "0-100", "101-200", "201-300" and so on.
The model returned a histogram with inconsistent and overlapping keys "0-100", "100-100", "100-200", "200-200", "300-300", "300-400" and so on.

- Model F and G (Test Case): The model is penalized since the test cause is failing because of returning "path": "GET /api/products" but the prompt states it should get "Path": "string". It doesn't explicitly mention whether the HTTP request method should be in the string. The test case should be passing. Hence, adjustment in the test case is required.

- One test case contains a typo "should correct calculate histograms," which should be "correctly".

Please address and fix these. The rest looks good.
