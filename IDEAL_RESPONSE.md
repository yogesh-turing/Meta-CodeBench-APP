The incorrect response failed to transform the request correctly, returning null values instead of the expected values from the input request. The path calculation logic is erroneous, the path calculation logic should ignore 'request.' part. 

The incorrect response did not check the value retrieved from the request for null or undefined. Hence it returns the values as "UNDEFINED" for the transformation rule `[[request.ticket.name, uppercase]]`

As compared with incorrect solution, the request is correctly transformed as per tranformation rules.
In ideal response the tranformation rules which are releated to 'request' (starts with request) are handled differently as these values are derived from request object.
Whereas generic rules like '[[now]]' are handled seperately.

Added seperated logic to handle keys ends with `_at`, converted these values to date string with given date format. The values which are not present are set to null.
