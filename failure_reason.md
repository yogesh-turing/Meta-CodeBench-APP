```


The model failed to check if `executionTime` is a positive number in `addTask` function.
When executionTime is zero it should throw an error, as zero is a neutral value, not a positive number.


In the `addDependency` function, if the dependency task does not exist it should throw an error.
The model failed to add a check if the dependency task is already present or not.
