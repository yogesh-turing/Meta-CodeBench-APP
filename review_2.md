The following change was not implemented:

Incorrect solution explanation and Ideal Response Explanation (+ Ideal Response): 

---
The explanation stated might be incorrect. The first point should return false instead of throwing an error, as per the prompt. Can you check this again for the ideal response code? The ideal response should comply with the prompt requirements.

YM: The `maxRequests` is used in constructor and in `isRequestAllowed` function. 
In constructor it should throw error if maxRequests is zero.
In isRequestAllowed it should return false.

---
 Adjustment is required in the ideal response explanation afterward. 
 YM: This is done

---
 Please double-check this point "parameter validations were added to the constructor, setUserRole, and isRequestAllowed functions" and the last point. 
 YM: added validation in constructor for `roleLimits` parameter
 
 ---
 Check the unit test "if maxRequests is zero then it should return false" again. The response evaluation review will be done after these adjustments are made.
 YM: The `maxRequests` is used in constructor and in `isRequestAllowed` function. 
In constructor it should throw error if maxRequests is zero.
In isRequestAllowed it should return false.

 ---
In the prompt, we have a requirement "if maxRequests is zero then it should return false." in tests we expect it to throw an error instead of false when maxRequests is 0, the tests need to match with the given prompt, after updating the tests, refill the Modal evaluations, also update incorrect solution, ideal solution, and their explanations.
YM: The `maxRequests` is used in constructor and in `isRequestAllowed` function. 
In constructor it should throw error if maxRequests is zero.
In isRequestAllowed it should return false.

 ---
ideal response - add constructor validation for 'roleLimits'.
 YM: added validation in constructor for `roleLimits` parameter
