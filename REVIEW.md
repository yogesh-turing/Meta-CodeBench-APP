I would like you to pause on the calibration sheet now and fix this task that is mentioned below. After fixing it, you can continue with the calibration sheet.
For Task 304014, you need to click on regenerate the responses because we need to ensure 'module.exports' is present in all the models (it has been added to the system message now). 
After clicking the regenerate response button, let me know if it adds 'module.exports' in all ten models.
 Secondly, you need to check the incorrect solution and then adjust the ideal response explanation. 
 Please review the completed task afterward before submitting it.
Here's a review of this task by the client on the incorrect solution (+explanation):
The code doesn't work on non-arrays, but that's not the only issue. It doesn't work on various edge cases that test varying depths of subarrays. So there must be a logical error that is not mentioned.
If possible, please fix the task where necessary by today. If you've already covered your working hours today, please finish them by tomorrow as early as possible.
