The prompt should explicitly specify which data structure to use for completedTasks and dependencies. This ensures consistency in implementation and testing.

Test cases should avoid validating hard-coded error messages. Instead, they should verify for generic errors. For example:

expect(() => taskManager.completeTask("Write Report")).toThrow("Task does not exist");

Can be rewritten as:

expect(() => taskManager.completeTask("Write Report")).toThrow(Error);


The incorrect solution used a Map to store task dependencies. While this approach is valid, the prompt did not specify which data structure should be used.
To address this, the prompt, the test cases, or both should be updated to provide explicit guidance.
